zendepo
=======

create zenodo deposit drafts based on gbif datasets

this script was written to create quick and simple deposit drafts of all
norwegian gbif datasets, so it does not do a lot of error handling and 
excepts you to look over the drafts before publishing them...!

usage
=======

add your zenodo api access token to config.py and find the gbif uuid of the
dataset you want to add to zenodo

$ zendepo.py <gbif uuid>
